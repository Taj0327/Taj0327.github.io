Hi there! Welcome to my page. I'm Aoji Tang, an MS student in [Statistics](https://stor.unc.edu) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests lie in (stochastic) nonlinear optimization, constrained optimization and distributed optimization. My advisor is [Prof. Michael J. O'Neill](https://michaeljoneill.github.io/). I'm currently seeking PhD opportunities in Fall 2026. Please feel free to reach out to me.

Before coming to UNC, I obtained my BS degree in mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in 2023. I also spent my 23Fall semester as an exchange student here at UNC STOR department.
